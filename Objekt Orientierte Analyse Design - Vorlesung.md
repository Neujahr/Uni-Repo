## Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)
	1- The requirements of a new feature are understood
	2- It is designed, implemented and tested
	3- Once completed, it is deployed to the production system and operated
This is done continuously through an interactive process

## Objekt-Orientierte Analyse und Design
**Ziel:** Designing and implementing Maintainable Software Systems continuously
**Contents:** 
- Presents tools, practices and methods for the phases requirements analysis, design, implementation
- Methods and practices to come up with good requirements
- Practices and methods to make it maintainable
- UML as a tool for discussing software design within teams (just enough UML)
- Design principles that promote maintainability and changeability
- Design patterns as solutions to common design problems 


# What is Software Engineering?

*Definition nach Ian Sommerville:*
	Software Engineering is an Engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use. 

Two highlights from the definition:
 1. **Engineering discipline** 
- Engineers make things work!
- They apply theories, methods and tools where these are appropriate
 They look for solutions to problems <font color=DC143C>even when there are no applicable theories and methods</font>
- Engineers also recognize that solution must work within organizational and financial constraints
 2. **..All aspects of software production...**
- Software Engineering is not just concerned with the technical process of dsoftware development
- It also includes activities suft as software project management and the development of tools, methods and theories to support software development, evolution, operation and maintenance.

## Engineering discipline: Organizational and Financial contraints

### The Iron Triangle of project management![[OOAD - SW Quality Triangle.png]]
It proclaims that:
1.  The quality of a project's results is contrained by its:
    - Cost (available: budget, engineers, other resources)
    - Time (available time, deadline)
    - Scope (features, provided functionality)
2. PM can trade between constraints
3. <font color=DC143C>Changes in one constraint require changes in others or quality will suffer.</font> 

The Iron Triangle and Software Engineering -> Software Engineering <font color=DC143C>recognizes</font> organizational and financial constraints.

## All Aspects of Software Production: SDLC

The software development lifecycle (SDLC) defines phases that all software or individual features go through, the phases are

1.  **Requirements analysis** -> *Understand what your client wants/needs*
    - Identifying and capturing requirements through client interactions 
    - Clearly defining and documenting requirements
2. **Design** -> *Design a solution that meets functional/non-functional requirements*
    - Designing and documenting the system architecture based on requirements
    - Made on different levels (system/components levels, class/code level)
    - Documentation may be done using well knowndiagrams like UML
3. **Implementation** -> *Actually build the system meeting the required goals*
    - Actual code is written, the system is built
    - Unit test is performed, i.e. veryfying the code based on requirements
4. **Testing** -> *Ensure that the whole system meets all requirements*
    - Testing the system as a whole through series of system tests
    - Reporting and fixing all forms of bugs and defects
5. **Maintenance/Operation** ->  *The system serves its purpose (earns money)*
    - Deliver system to the client (shipping to client, provisioning over the internet)
    - Observation to identify bugs, malfunctions, opportunities for improvement

This lecture will focus primarily on the phases requirement analysis, design and implementation. Other phases of the SDLC will be addressed in the lecture Software Engineering
